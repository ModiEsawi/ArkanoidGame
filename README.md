# ArkanoidGame

## Collision Detection, Paddle and Blocks

The Ball is the first component of our Arkanoid game. In this assignment you will build two additional components: Blocks, that are obstacles on the screen,
and Paddle which is the "player" -- a block controlled by the keyboard. When the ball hits either the blocks or the paddle, it will change its direction.
In this assignment, the blocks will remain on the screen after being hit -- we will deal with block removal in future assignments.

to make the game a bit more fancy , we will make the paddle to change its color when it will be hit by the ball.

this is the first version of the arkanoid game which we will keep improving in the next assignments.
